\abstract{With the increase of the LHC luminosity foreseen in the coming years many detectors currently used in the different LHC experiments will be dramatically impacted and some need to be replaced. The new ones should be capable not only to support the high particle rate but also to provide time information to reduce the data ambiguity due to the expected high pileup.

RPC using low-resistivity Bakelite are proposed to equip the very forward region of the CMS detector. In their single-gap version they can stand rates of few $\khzcm$. New electronics equipped with excellent timing precision measurement (<150ps) are being developed to read out the RPC detectors from both side of the strips to allow good spatial resolution along them. The absolute time measurement, determined by RPC signal (around 1 ns) will also reduce the data ambiguity due to the highly expected pileup at the Level 1 trigger and help to identify Heavy Scalar Charged Particles (HSCP).

Principle of the measurement, implementation in front-end electronic boards (Petiroc front-end ASIC, wave-union TDC and PCB design) will be discussed. First results from cosmic tests and test beams at Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) and SPS at CERN would also be presented.

\section{Introduction}

In the present CMS detector, all the muon stations are equipped with two kinds of muon detectors.  Drift Tubes (DT) and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) detectors are used to ensure a good redundancy in the barrel region.  In the endcap region, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) and RPC are used except in the stations of high eta region ($\eta > 1.8$) where only CSC detectors are present.
To guarantee a redundancy in this region and improve the muon trigger efficiency it is planned to add new chambers during long shut-downs LS2 and LS3. The projected increase of the LHC luminosity  up to $5-7 \cdot 10^{34}$\,cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ during the HL-LHC phase suggests that new detectors with high rate capability are needed~\cite{upgrade}.
Fig. \ref{fig.upgrade} summarizes the project of the upgrade of the muon spectrometer. 
Gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) detectors are proposed to equip the first of these four high $\eta$ muon stations and improved RPC chambers (iRPC) the last two stations (RE3/1 and RE4/1). In this region the expected rate during HL-LHC program estimated with FLUCKA shall not exceed 2\,$\khzcm$ including a safety factor 3 \cite{upgrade}. The new stations are required to detect muons with an efficiency above 95\% under those background conditions and to sustain a total integration charge of 1 C/cm$^2$ corresponding to the full period of operations during the HL-LHC program. A good intrinsic time resolution would improve the rejection of background hits and low $p_{\rm T}$ tracks. It would also help to resolve ambiguities in the endcap trigger
for multiple tracks identification and allows reconstruction of slowly moving Heavy Stable Charged Particles (HSCP).

\section{Description of the iRPC project}

\subsection{Gas gaps}

The classical RPC chambers of CMS are doublet RPC detectors each made of two 2.0 mm HPL electrodes, with a typical bulk resistivity of $1-6 \cdot 10^{10}\ohmcm$ and separated by a gas gap of the same thickness. The electronics reading those chambers is sensitive to a minimal charge left by a muon of 150 fC \cite{????}.
They were shown to be operational up to 600\,$\hzcm$, but above their efficiency was declining. To sustain a 3 times larger rate different parameters we had to modify the parameters of the electrodes.

A reduction of the electrodes resistivity and thickness would improve the total evacuation flow of the charge. The chamber could sustain a higher background. A thinner gas gap would reduce the produced charge per background hit and stress less the electrodes with aging effect. The drawback of this approach is a smaller charge left by a muon. Therefore to keep the sensitivity as high as possible more sensitive electronics is required.

Two types of electrodes fulfilling the HL-LHC requirements were proposed: aluminium doped glass \cite{???} and modified HPL electrodes. The latter solution was privileged by the collaboration as a more familiar one with respect to the Phase I CMS system. The parameters of the iRPC that was found to fulfill the Phase II requirements are summarized in Table \ref{???}. The first tests was successfully performed at KODEL laboratory and in Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) \cite{???} to validate the properties of the gaps.

\subsection{Electronics}

The baseline readout electronics foreseen for this project is based on a thin (0.6 mm) Printed Circuit Board (PCB), 160 cm long, equipped with 48 pickup strips of the same length inserted between two HPL gaps. In order to maximize charges induction between the gaps and the strips, we must minimize thickness of the FR4 layers of the PCB. Considering the large size of the PCB, 300 $\mu$m of FR4 on each side of the strips seems to be the minimal acceptable value in terms of mechanical rigidity and handling capabilities.
Two PCBs would readout a full chamber that covers an azimuthal region of 20 $\deg$. The strips of an average pitch of 0.75 cm are read out from both ends, the one that is located at the low radius of the iRPC ring (LR) and the other at the high radius (HR). Both signal are fed into the same Front-End Board (FEB) in such a way that the time difference between them $\DT = T_{\rm HR} - T_{\rm LR}$ largely cancel out jitter effects down to $\approx 200 {\rm ps}$. Subsequently $\DT$ can be directly related to the along-strip space resolution.

To maximize the signal collected on the both ends of the strip the FEB impedance is precisely matched to the one of the strips. It was observed that strips impedance is defined by the distance between the strips and the Faraday cage enclosing the chamber and is very dependant on the exact chamber design. In the configuration proposed for iRPC an impedance of 44 $\Omega$ was determined \cite{????}.

The FEB is carrying two components a fast front-end ASIC (PETIROC2 \cite{???}) and a time-to-digital converter (TDC). The PETIROC2 [2], it is a 32 channels version developed in SiGe technology. It hosts a preamplifier with a 1 GHz bandwidth and gain of 25 associated with a fast programmable comparator. Comparator output for each PETIROC channel is fed into an Altera cyclone II FPGA hosting the time-to-digital (TDC) conversion module. A light data Acquisition System designed initially for the Semi Digital HCAL prototype of ILD detector project, is used for the data acquisition \cite{???} and packing into a binary format.

The electronics calibration procedure starts from the alignment of the pedestals of all the comparators inside a PETIROC chip, and more generally among all the PETIROCS. We define then a global threshold for all the comparators in such a way that the amount of noise do not exceed 5\,$\hzcm$ as requested by the CMS trigger constraints. The difference between the pedestal and the actual threshold is converted into a charge seen by the electronics using a calibration factor measured independently. 

%We perform this procedure in three separated stages. Each time, the threshold of the comparator is lowered step by step with a short acquisition window and output data are recorded.

%The first step, with only one channel activated at once in the PETIROC ASIC, we obtain data used to align all channels pedestal DAC values. Those data are individually saved in a configuration database. Then, with all channels activated together and the same procedure is applied in order to check alignment computed in first step. Lastly, with all channels activated together we can hunt for system noises or grounding issues to determine a common threshold to be applied to all the electronic channels for the data taking with a real detector. The DAQ unit used to define the threshold was calibrated and corresponds to 2.5 fC of observed charge.

Full size prototypes of the iRPC detector were built in 2017 to test two different ways to connect the PCB to the FEB (see Fig. \ref{???}): using 50 $\Omega$ coaxial cables running outside of the Faraday cage (referred to as COAX) or return strips embedded into the PCB (RETURN). It was observed that in general the RETURN prototype is better protected from the grounding and pickup noise than the COAX one. During the test beams we had to use a threshold of 81 (108) fC for RETURN (COAX) prototypes

\section{Chambers caracterisations}

The prototypes was extensively tested in cosmic rays and then in 2 sessions of test beams in GIF++ during 6 weeks. A low intensity muon beam was hitting the chamber together with a uniformly distributed photon background generated by a $^{137}$Cs source.

A muon is considered as detected if he was seen by at least 1 strip from both sides within a time window around the expected arrival of the trigger that is delayed by 600 ns due to the length of the cables. The size of this time window is defined as $\pm3\sigma_{\rm T}$, with $\sigma_{\rm T} \approx 2 ns$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig.T}. This value if defined by a convolution of the trigger jitter, scintillators size and the intrinsic jitter of the chamber. We have measured this latter to be $0.8$\,ns one by comparing the difference of the time of arrival of the signal between the HR side of the two chambers. The obtained resolution can be then divide by $\sqrt{2}$ assuming the chambers electronics identical and uncorrelated (see Fig. \ref{fig.T}). If many strips are localized in space and time they are gathered together in clusters. The typical cluster size is around 1.2-1.3 strips depending on the strips pitch and rate.

The presence of muons was also indetifyed by an independent telescope made of 4 scintillators with an effective area well inside the detector acceptance. The efficiency of the chambers was then measured comparing the number of indetifyed muons with those who left a signal in the chamber. It is shown in Fig. \ref{fig.eff} shows efficiencies for different rates. This latter is defined as the number of clusters seen by the chamber. We observe that the efficiency of the chamber stays above 95\% up to 2\,$\khzcm$ as required by the project specifications. Both prototypes shows a similar efficiency. The chamber can be operated at a voltage as low as 7.3 kV for small background and 7.6 kV for maximum rate.

The space resolution was measured with high precision at the H2 line of SPS complex with 2 thin scintillators and a special table (produced by DESY) that allow an horizontal and vertical shift of the chambers with a millimetric precision. We observed in Fig.~\ref{fig.DT} an excellent $\DT$ resolution of the order of 130 ns in the center of the chamber (90 cm from high radius) that can be converted into the space resolution $\Delta x \approx 1.3$\,cm using the formula $\Delta x = v \cdot \Delta {\rm T} / 2$. The speed of the signal propagation $v$ was measured looking on the shift of $\DT$ in ns when the table is displaced by $x$\,cm (see Fig.~\ref{fig.DT}).
